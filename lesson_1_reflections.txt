How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it spotted only the text has been changed.
    this helps me because it gives me the oportunity
    to find the possible mistake in much fewer lines.
    it helps me focus on the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can go back in time and see
    the changes, how your work evolves
    by comparing these files you can find possible bug.
    it helps you to rewind at time spots and this provide
    an excellent backup feature.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros
    logical meaning in changes
    compiles for sure

    cons
    requires time and programmer's interaction
    can be to small
    can be to big


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git is focused on progrmming 
    where there are many cases in which
    one logical change in affects more files.
    exampes are php,html,css,js files in web development 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first git log allow you to spot the commits and find how the changes evolved
    then git diff show you the additions and deletions in files with useful colors


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can go back and fixit
    this gives me confidence
    i can explore changes in code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version controlling of my first projet in android
